# Manga Yomu

## What is it?

MangaYomu will be a mobile application for manga reading. I plan to create a single-page application version of it for desktop devices.

## Setup

Make sure to have the following installed:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

Then run

```sh
npm run setup
```

## Notice

At the time of writing this (1/15/23), it is a pain to have `react-native` work with `pnpm`. `apps/mobile` will have to run with regular npm.

## Todo

- Add database
- Add web version
- Add manga page sharing (share page that redirects to web app version)
