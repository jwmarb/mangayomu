## What is MangaYomu?

MangaYomu is a both a web and a native mobile application for reading manga/manhwa/manhua, whose sources are
prevalent throughout Asia. Many of these reading materials are not available locally in many foreign countries, although,
there are many websites that offer manga-reading services for free. **MangaYomu does NOT host or provide these reading materials**, but
**it provides you a way to access these reading materials from different source providers--all in one application**.

## Why use MangaYomu?

There are so many websites that offer free reading materials, which is a problem when you use multiple websites to read
manga/manhwa/manhua. Cross-saving progression does not exist, and all of these websites use your browser's local storage
to store information about what mangas you have read. It is an issue if you want to continue where you left off in a
different device, and you are forced to sync your data manually, which can be a tedious process.

MangaYomu solves this by offering a free cloud storage solution and by providing a way to manage these source providers
in one application. MangaYomu is offline-first, meaning cloud storage is optional, so you do not have to go through the
process of signing up and go straight to reading.

## Sources

MangaYomu can provide any source as long as there is someone willing to maintain an API that gets data from that source.
